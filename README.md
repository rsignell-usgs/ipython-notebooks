ipython-notebooks
=================

A collection of notebooks, most demonstrating standards-based access of ocean model output and ocean data

All of these notebooks can be viewed in the nbviewer application by going to nbviewer.ipython.org and entering the raw github url.  Some examples:

 * Demonstration of an OGC Catalog Services for the Web (CSW) query using a bounding box, time range, keywords, and the specific web service that is desired (e.g. WCS, OPeNDAP)

 * Visualizing forecast ocean surface currents from an unstructured grid ocean model (IOOS NERACOOS Region):
